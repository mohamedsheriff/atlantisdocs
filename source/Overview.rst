Why Atlantis 2.0
*****************

Atlantis Automation
--------------------

Atlantis automation engine  streamlines operations of urban infrastructure to enhance urban management through automation. The platform comprises various dev and integeration tools to simplify the data acquisation from various smartcity datasources like IOT Sensors, Opendata, GIS sources, governance IT systems, Operational systems (legacy systems like scada), Crowd sourced data, etc. 

Some of the core capabilities of Automation Engine are:-
    * Visualization Layer (Dashboard)
        * Flexible dasboard 
        * multiple and configurable widgets for operatoinal and BI reports
        * Geo spatial visualization with ability to integerate with city's GIS datasources
        * Videowall for to view city's live camera feeds
        * locationalization and personalization capabilities
    * Data & Process Orchestration Layer
        *  Data integration adatpers for data acquisation
        *  Data preparation pipeline for visualization
        *  Complex event processing for standard operating procedure automation (SOP)
    * Administration
        * User management   
        * flexible role based access control system
    * Media Encoding
        * encode realtime enconding for rtsp steams to webrtc stream to pluginless video display
    * Data platform
        * Flexible data platform for metric aggregation
        * Stream & CEP processing for realtime analytics
        * Metric aggregation for fast access

Atlantis Recommmendation
------------------------

Atlantis Recommendation engine is a AI based platform for urban planner and decision makers. The platform provides over 65+ urban analytics as webservice with inbuilt training life cycle covering near realtime training, imputations and predictions. 

----------------
Urban Indicators
---------------- 
Helps city planners to understand city at macrolevel and helps in aiding planning decisions. The models are based on analysis “Satellite” and “Drone” Imagery. Some of the key indicators are “urban vegetation”, “urban sprawl”, “underground water propensity”, “land use and land cover analysis”, “suitability analytics”

--------------------
Predictive Analytics
--------------------
Use data from sensors, IT and open data sources to forecast and predict future state. Some key models are “Parking Occupancy Forecasting”, “Environment prediction”,“Smart bit fill level predictions”, “Traffic Congestion Predication” 

----------------------
Prescriptive Analytics
----------------------
The models recommend action to be taken for optimizing city operations. Some of the models are “optimized lighting policies”, “Traffic hotspot analysis”, “route optimizations”

-------------------
Resilient Analytics
-------------------
The models provide potential impact areas and remedial options for urban resilience like Gas Leakage, Traffic jams, Traffic impact on environment 

---------------
Video Analytics
---------------
The models identify safety, security, crowd & traffic incidents & metrics based on video imagery. Some of the models are “Number Plate Recognition”, “Intrusion detection”, “Traffic and crowd estimation”, “Suspicious object detection”, “Cleanliness detection”, “Vandalism detection”

--------------
Text Analytics
--------------
The models are used for classification, sentiment analysis and conversational interfaces . Some of the key models include citizen sentiment analysis, citizen grievances classification, social sentiment analysis and conversational chat interface to city data
