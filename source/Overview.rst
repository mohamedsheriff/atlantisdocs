Smartcity Overview
*******************

The Smart City initiatives launched more than a decade ago form one of the key developments in the digital transformation of public sector. In the recent times, there has been a substantial raise in the number of smart cities project across the globe and also their relative ambitions. Over the years, the concept of smart cities has evolved from streamlining functioning of city operation to digitally connected cities and now is converging towards delivering better quality of life through better decisions using the city data. With the amalgamation of AI and the gamut of data from city operations, AI now becomes main stay in smart cities for smarter decision making. There is also a fundamental shift in the driving force of Smart City development from being technology-driven, government-driven, and citizen-driven. 

Smart City Platform and its Challenges
********************

The traditional Smart City platform converges the city operation in an unified view by integrating sensor from various city domains and in the process - automate the city infrastructures through policies and Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs).  However, the continuous evolution of the Smart City programs requires a robust Smart City technology platform that can accommodate the increasing ambitions of the cities.
Following are the key functional challenges in the current breed of Smart City platforms:
    * Increase in time taken to integrate sensors across Smart City domains
    * Need for skilled resources to create simple city data visualizations
    * High Maintenance Cost that leads to increase in the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
    * No native or limited Artificial Intelligence capability that would provide recommendations and insights for city operations
    * Complexity in harnessing cross-domain intelligence across Smart City domains
    * Inability to correlate events across multiple domains form the streaming of city data
    * Limited ability to marshal multiple resources during natural calamities
    * Limitations in integrating multiple data sources such as: ERP, Open Data, Government Portals, Legacy Systems, Social Media and so on
    * Inability to provide civic participation without the capability of out-of-the-box citizen engagement 
    * Inability to provide visibility of the field activities in the cities without the out-of-the-box capability for managing the field workers of departments in government sector
    * Lack of platform openness and limited interoperability leading to lack of thriving developer ecosystem and collaborative models

Why Atlantis 2.0
*****************

Easier Integration
------------------
This Platform comes with a built-in data integration studio that would help you build adapters with reduced complexity for various sources including IoT sensors from various vendors, existing IT, OT (SCADA), E-governance, Open Data, Social Media and so on. In addition to this, the studio is also loaded with numerous out-of-the-box adapters, hundreds of data manipulation functions, and connectors that make the data integration easier.
Low Code and Rapid Development
This Platform comes with flow-based self-service orchestration studio with no or low code development to integrate data, process events, configure rules and frame Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) that helps in rapid development and accelerates the digital transformation of the cities.

Architected to Scale
------------------
This Platform can be used in both tactical and strategic approaches depending on the cities’ requirement. This means that this platform is scalable from starting the city initiative with few point solution and later scale out for multiple city domains to drive the citywide outcomes. 
High Security, Availability, and Performance
This Platform leverages a multi-layered security and data encryption as a default. It offers Security, Availability, and Performance using microservices with unified identity and Security Management.

Multitude Deployment Choice
------------------
This Platform provides multitude of deployment choices wherein, this platform can be deployed within a data center of choice or Public Cloud or a Private Cloud.

Artificial Intelligence based Analytics
------------------ 
This Platform has a built-in capability to provide key recommendations and insights on Artificial Intelligence (AI) based predictive and prescriptive analytics. This capability requires additional licenses to be functional.
The following are some of the models of an Artificial Intelligence based Analytics:
    *  **Predictive Analytics** : Uses data from sensors, IT, and open data sources to forecast and predict future state. Some key models include Parking Occupancy Forecasting, Environment prediction, Smart Bin fill level predictions, Traffic Congestion Prediction 
    *  **Prescriptive Analytics** : These models recommend action to be taken for optimizing city operations. Some of the models are Optimized lighting Policies, Traffic Hotspot Analysis, Route Optimizations
    *  **Urban Indicators** : Helps City Planners to understand city at a macro level and assists in aiding planning decisions. The models are based on the analysis of Satellite and Drone Imagery. Some of the key indicators are: Urban Vegetation, Urban Sprawl, Underground Water Propensity, Land Use and Land Cover Analysis, Suitability Analytics
    *  **Resilient Analytics** : These models provide potential impact areas and remedial options for urban resilience such as: Gas Leakage, Traffic Jams, and impact of traffic on environment
    *  **Video Analytics** : These models identify Safety, Security, Crowd & Traffic incidents, and metrics based on video imagery. Some of the models are:  Number Plate Recognition, Intrusion Detection, Traffic and Crowd Estimation, Suspicious Object Detection, Cleanliness Detection, and Vandalism Detection
    *  **Text Analytics** :  These models are used for Classification, Sentiment Analysis and Conversational Interfaces. Some of the key models include: Citizen Sentiment Analysis, Citizen Grievances Classification, Social Sentiment Analysis, and Conversational Chat Interface-to-City Data

Business Intelligence Capabilities
------------------
This Platform provides business intelligence capabilities through self-service reporting capabilities to build domain and cross-domain visual intelligence through best fit visualizations such as:. graph, maps, tables, and so on with slice-and-dice capabilities.

Visualization and Collaboration
------------------
This Platform provides self-service capabilities to build best fit visualization dashboards for city wide operations management and also reporting for city administrator. Additionally, the dashboards and reports can be shared with other users for collaboration. 

Automation Capabilities
------------------
This Platform provides rich automation framework and self-service flow-based orchestration studio to process the data and events in real-time using real time engine. The engine provides the capability automate the Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) based on simple and Complex Event Process Analytical Engine (CEP Engine) 

Citizen Engagement
------------------  
This Platform provides Citizen Services capabilities using purposely built mobile applications for respective cities. This Platform provides capabilities covering Citizen-to-Government (C2G), Citizen-to-Business, Emergency, Transportation, Citizen-to-Citizen services, City Announcements, and Citizen Grievance management. This capability requires additional licenses and advance services to function.
Last Mile Connectivity and Transparency
This Platform provides out-of-the-box capability to bridge this platform with the field officers working in different government department. This helps in percolation of issues raised from different sources to reach the last mile field workers for complete closure and in the same time bringing in complete transparency in city operations.

Openness and Collaboration Models
------------------
This Platform provides open and fully documented API, with complete interoperability, to enable ecosystem partners and other third parties to build value-added and differentiated solutions on the top of this platform. In addition to this, the open API can be cataloged as part of cities’ open data platforms such as: CKAN and DKAN.
